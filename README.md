# Leagues Planner and Pather

## Info
This plugin builds off of the "shortest-path" plugin by Skretzo. Located at https://github.com/Skretzo/shortest-path . Full credit goes to that plugin for all pathfinding capabilities.

Please view the readme on his page for more information on that.

This plugin is to aid people for planning their route in the upcoming trailblazer 2 league. The plugin allows people to put in their own custom tasks or hook into tasks I've manually added into the planning. With this, you can visually see where tasks can be completed and the plugin forks from the shortest path plugin from Skretzo (with his permission) to allow pathing between points.
